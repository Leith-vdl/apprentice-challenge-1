            <h3>A Slightly Ridiculous Investigation</h3>
            <p>
                For centuries, humanity has pondered great mysteries: Why is the sky blue? What is the
                meaning of life? And most importantly, why do dogs like bones? Today, we embark on a
                journey to uncover the truth behind this canine obsession. Prepare yourself for a deep dive into
                science, history, and a touch of absurdity.

            <h3>Wild Instincts: The Ancestral Chew-Fest</h3>
            <p>
                Before dogs became the pampered couch-dwellers they are today, they were fierce, wild
                hunters. Their ancestors—Canis lupus and other prehistoric dog-like creatures—had to work for
                their food. Bones weren’t just a snack; they were a survival tool packed with marrow, the
                original all-natural energy drink. In the wild, the best bone-chewers developed strong jaws
                and an insatiable craving for femurs. Modern dogs, despite having food delivered to them in
                shiny metal bowls, still carry this instinct.
